.. guideline:: Integer shift shall only be performed through `checked_` APIs
    :id: gui_L1efkdhJroHY 
    :category: mandatory
    :status: draft
    :release: 1.7.0-latest
    :fls: fls_sru4wi5jomoe
    :decidability: decidable
    :scope: module
    :tags: numerics, reduce-human-error, maintainability, portability, surprising-behavior

    In particular, the user should only perform left shifts via the `checked_shl <https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/index.html?search=%22checked_shl%22>`_ function and right shifts via the `checked_shr <https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/index.html?search=%22checked_shr%22>`_ function. Both of these functions exist in `core <https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/index.html>`_.

    This rule applies to the following primitive types:


    * ``i8``
    * ``i16``
    * ``i32``
    * ``i64``
    * ``i128``
    * ``u8``
    * ``u16``
    * ``u32``
    * ``u64``
    * ``u128``
    * ``usize``
    * ``isize``

    .. rationale:: 
        :id: rat_eo9iSNAyUWop 
        :status: draft

        This is directly inspired by `INT34-C. Do not shift an expression by a negative number of bits or by greater than or equal to the number of bits that exist in the operand <https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/INT34-C.+Do+not+shift+an+expression+by+a+negative+number+of+bits+or+by+greater+than+or+equal+to+the+number+of+bits+that+exist+in+the+operand>`_.

        In Rust these out-of-range shifts don't give rise to Undefined Behavior; however, they are still problematic in Safety Critical contexts for two reasons.

        **Reason 1: inconsistent behavior**

        The behavior of shift operations depends on the compilation mode. Say for example, that we have a number ``x`` of type ``uN``\ , and we perform the operation

        ``x << M`` 

        Then, it will behave like this:

        .. list-table::
           :header-rows: 1

           * - **Compilation Mode**
             - ``0 <= M < N``
             - ``M < 0``
             - ``N <= M``
           * - Debug
             - Shifts normally
             - Panics
             - Panics
           * - Release
             - Shifts normally
             - Shifts by ``M mod N``
             - Shifts by ``M mod N``


        ..

           Note: the behavior is exactly the same for the ``>>`` operator.


        Panicking in ``Debug`` is an issue by itself, however, a perhaps larger issue there is that its behavior is different from that of ``Release``. Such inconsistencies aren't acceptable in Safety Critical scenarios.

        Therefore, a consistently-behaved operation should be required for performing shifts.

        Reason 2: programmer intent
        ===========================

        There is no scenario in which it makes sense to perform a shift of negative length, or of more than ``N - 1`` bits. The operation itself becomes meaningless.

        Therefore, an API that restricts the length of the shift to the range ``[0, N - 1]`` should be used instead of the ``<<`` and ``>>`` operators.

        The Solution
        ============

        The ideal solution for this exists in ``core``\ : ``checked_shl`` and ``checked_shr``.

        ``<T>::checked_shl(M)`` returns a value of type ``Option<T>``\ , in the following way:


        * If ``M < 0``\ , the output is ``None``
        * If ``0 <= M < N`` for ``T`` of ``N`` bits, then the output is ``Some(T)``
        * If ``N <= M``\ , the output is ``None``

        This API has consistent behavior across ``Debug`` and ``Release``\ , and makes the programmer intent explicit, which effectively solves this issue.

    .. non_compliant_example::
        :id: non_compl_ex_4RnVPjQs06uM 
        :status: draft

        As seen below in the ``non_compliant_example()`` function:


        * A ``Debug`` build **panics**\ , 
        * 
          Whereas a ``Release`` build prints the values:

          .. code-block::

             61 << -1 = 2147483648
             61 << 4 = 976
             61 << 40 = 15616

        This shows **Reason 1** prominently.

        **Reason 2** is not seen in the code, because it is a reason of programmer intent: shifts by less than 0 or by more than ``N - 1`` (\ ``N`` being the bit-length of the value being shifted) are both meaningless.

        .. code-block:: rust

            fn non_compliant_example() {
                  fn bad_shl(bits: u32, shift: i32) -> u32 {
                      bits << shift
                  }

                  let bits : u32 = 61;
                  let shifts = vec![-1, 4, 40];

                  for sh in shifts {
                      println!("{bits} << {sh} = {}", bad_shl(bits, sh));
                  }
              }

    .. compliant_example::
        :id: compl_ex_n0Is3JLe1YwT 
        :status: draft

        As seen below in the ``compliant_example()`` function:


        * Both ``Debug`` and ``Release`` give the same exact output, which addresses **Reason 1**.
        * Shifting by negative values is impossible due to the fact that ``checked_shl`` only accepts unsigned integers as shift lengths.
        * Shifting by more than ``N - 1`` (\ ``N`` being the bit-length of the value being shifted) returns a ``None`` value:
          .. code-block::

             61 << 4 = Some(976)
             61 << 40 = None

        The last 2 observations show how this addresses **Reason 2**.

        .. code-block:: rust

            fn compliant_example() {
                  fn good_shl(bits: u32, shift: u32) -> Option<u32> {
                      bits.checked_shl(shift)
                  }

                  let bits : u32 = 61;
                  // let shifts = vec![-1, 4, 40];
                  //                    ^--- Would not typecheck, as checked_shl
                  //                         only accepts positive shift amounts
                  let shifts = vec![4, 40];

                  for sh in shifts {
                      println!("{bits} << {sh} = {:?}", good_shl(bits, sh));
                  }
              }
